# Project-Users
A Python project I made for practice

Basically, you create people, you find people, and you can change anyones info with the admin account

# Accessing admin
You login with the default admin account. The username and password is admin
If you want to make a new admin account, please use the Firstname as a Password as I have not implemented passwords yet
